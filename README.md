# The-Island-of-Knights-and-Liars-puzzle
Problem Statement: You visit an island inhabited by knights (always tell the truth) and liars (always lie). You encounter three people named Alex, Ben, and Chris. Alex says, "Both Ben and I are knights." Ben says, "Chris is a liar." Chris says, "I am a knight, and Alex is a liar." Determine the identities of Alex, Ben, and Chris.
Solution: Analyzing their statements, we can determine:

If Alex is a knight, both statements would be true, but that contradicts Ben's statement. Therefore, Alex is a liar.
If Ben is a knight, his statement about Chris being a liar would be false, contradicting Chris's statement. So, Ben is also a liar.
Since Alex and Ben are liars, Chris's statement about being a knight and Alex being a liar is also false. Hence, Chris is the knight.
Therefore, the identities are:

Alex: Liar
Ben: Liar
Chris: Knight
